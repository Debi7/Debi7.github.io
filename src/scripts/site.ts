// Site-wide client script. Imported once from src/layouts/Base.astro; Astro bundles it.
//
// Was site.js until 2026-09-22. Renamed to .ts so that `npm run check` looks at it: as a .js file
// it was compiled by Vite and shipped to every visitor without a single type ever being checked,
// which is the one part of the tree where a typo survived all three commands in the workflow. The
// project's tsconfig does set allowJs, so it was not invisible to the editor - but astro check
// reports no diagnostics for a plain .js file, and this is the file where a wrong property name on
// a DOM node fails silently in the browser instead of loudly at build time.
//
// What the rename cost, and it is the point of doing it: the annotations below. Each one records a
// contract the JavaScript only implied - which two strings a theme can be, that a click target is
// not always a Node, that the KaTeX global may be missing. The bodies are unchanged.
//
// This is the "typing the ported scripts" item that CLAUDE.md parked behind the parity question;
// that question was answered on 2026-09-16 (Hugo is a checkpoint, the project adopts Astro
// practice), which is what makes the rename allowed now. Nothing about the emitted bundle changes:
// TypeScript annotations are erased, and the browser gets the same code as before.
//
// TODO(migration §7): copy, verbatim, the remaining inline script blocks in
//   ../klub_biolocation/themes/void/layouts/partials/head/js.html
//     (code copy buttons, footnote back-links, hash highlight, TOC active state,
//      heading anchor copy)
// and the whole of
//   ../klub_biolocation/themes/void/assets/js/main.js
// Not the theme bootstrap (localStorage -> `dark` class): that one stays inline in
// src/components/Head.astro so it runs before the stylesheets load.

// --- Theme (dark / light) ---
// Ported ahead of §7 because the header's toggle button is useless without it.
// Verbatim from the themeInit block in head/js.html, including the DOMContentLoaded
// wrapper: Astro emits this bundle as a deferred module, which still runs before
// DOMContentLoaded fires, so the timing matches Hugo's.
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  // --- Math ---
  // Also ported ahead of §7. The CDN tag in Head.astro calls `renderMathInElement` with no
  // options, and KaTeX's DEFAULT delimiters are `$$...$$`, `\(...\)` and `\[...\]` - single
  // `$...$` is not among them. The theme enables it with this second call, so without it a
  // formula written as `$E = mc^2$` stays visible as source text. That shows up on the Posts
  // page, whose summary for article.md contains exactly that.
  //
  // Changed 2026-09-22: the first sentence above no longer holds. The CDN tag in Head.astro does
  // not call renderMathInElement at all now - its onload attribute was removed, because it ran a
  // whole typesetting pass with the default delimiters that this call then repeated properly. The
  // rest of the note still applies: this is where the single `$...$` delimiter is enabled, and it
  // is now the only pass over the document.
  //
  // Guarded for the same reason. Until today two independent things called into KaTeX, so a CDN
  // that failed to answer cost only the formulas. With one call left, an undefined
  // renderMathInElement would throw here and take the whole DOMContentLoaded listener with it -
  // the theme switch, and every block ported into this file after it, would stop working because
  // a third-party host was down. `typeof` on an undeclared name is the one test that does not
  // throw by itself.
  //
  // Superseded later the same day, by the owner's decision: there is no call here any more. The
  // math is typeset by rehype-katex while the page is built (astro.config.mjs has the reasoning),
  // so by the time this file runs the formulas are already KaTeX markup and there is nothing for a
  // client-side pass to find. The KaTeX CDN tags in Head.astro went with it. The notes above are
  // kept because they explain a real trap: client-side typesetting had never actually worked on
  // this site, since remark-math consumes the dollars that auto-render looks for. Anyone tempted
  // to put the call back should read them first.
