# Astro migration plan

Rewrite this Hugo site as an Astro 4 project with the same visual result. This file is written so that it can be executed step by step, in several short sessions, by a person or an AI assistant with limited context. Each phase ends with a check that can be run without judgement calls.

Hugo reference project: `../klub_biolocation`. Every `themes/void/...`, `layouts/...`, `content/...` and `public/...` path below is relative to it. What is already implemented is tracked in the "Progress" section directly below, section by section; [README.md](README.md), "Skeleton status", lists the same thing file by file. Keep both current when a step is finished.

## Progress

Status as of 2026-09-09. "Stub" means the file and its route exist and the build is green, but the page still renders placeholder markup and the file carries a `TODO(migration §N)` comment naming its Hugo source.

| Plan section                                         | Status      | Where it stands                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| §4 `en.toml` -> `src/i18n/strings.ts`                | Done        | All keys ported; the two that take a value in Hugo are functions                                                                                                                                                |
| §5.1-5.4 Collections, drafts, slugs, reading time    | Done        | `src/content/config.ts`, `src/lib/*.ts`, `src/config.ts`                                                                                                                                                        |
| §5.5 Route parity                                    | Done        | Only the nine Hugo-only `/page/1/` aliases differ, as accepted in §9                                                                                                                                            |
| §6 Markdown pipeline (code blocks, footnotes)        | Not started |                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| §7 Client-side JavaScript                            | Partly      | Theme bootstrap, CDN tags and the carousel script are in place; the theme toggle and the KaTeX `$...$` delimiter call were pulled forward. The rest of `head/js.html` and `assets/js/main.js` are still to come |
| §8 Verification                                      | Partly      | Routes verified. Every page except the single-post layout diffed and screenshotted against Hugo in both themes; see the note below                                                                              |
| §9 Accepted deviations                               | Changed     | 2026-09-19: pagination is built, 5 posts a page (the owner's choice; Hugo's default is 10), and each page shows its own posts, unlike the theme's templates                                                     |

Section 4.1 tracks the same thing per **menu item**, which is the unit the work is actually done in. **All five are now ported**: Home, Categories, Posts, Tags and About, together with every page they link to except the single-post layout.

Against the session split in §10: sessions 1, 2 and 4 are complete except `Footer.astro`; session 3 is complete apart from `Post.astro`, which needs the §6 Markdown pipeline first. Sessions 5 and 6 have not started.

**Verification reached so far.** Every route except the two single-post pages has been diffed against the Hugo build node by node and screenshotted at 1280x900 in both themes. `/`, `/about/` and `/tags/` are pixel-identical. The rest differ only at the level of antialiasing: the count digits on `/categories/` (55 pixels, max 4/255) and the year-badge gradient on the list and tag pages (up to 5,845 pixels, max 3/255 - see deviation 6 in §9). Markup differences are limited to what Hugo's own HTML minifier does to its output. `aria-current` on the menu matches Hugo on all six routes. `npm run check` exits 0, `npm run build` is green and `npm run dev` starts clean.

### Amendments to the plan, discovered while executing it

1. **The palette had to be pinned (§3.2).** Tailwind 4 did not merely re-encode the v3 palette in `oklch`, it re-tuned it: converted back to sRGB, `blue-600` (the link colour) differs by 17/255 and `green-600` by 22/255, while the greys differ by at most 3/255. §3.2's config table did not cover this. `theme.extend.colors` now pins the 19 colours the compiled Hugo stylesheet defines. Tailwind 4 tree-shakes its theme, so that file lists only the colours the site uses today: a colour class introduced by a later step must have its value re-derived from `reference/hugo-main.css` rather than taken from the Tailwind 3 default.
2. **`@types/node` added as a devDependency.** `Carousel.astro` reads `public/images/carousel/` at build time, which is what §4 prescribes; without the Node types `astro check` fails. This does not touch the pinned Astro or Tailwind versions.
3. **The active menu item is not highlighted, by design (§4).** The Hugo menu partial emits two `class` attributes on the current link, so the `active font-bold` half is dropped by the browser and `.active` is styled nowhere. `Menu.astro` reproduces the rendered result and emits only `aria-current`. Adding the highlight would be a design change, not a port fix.
4. **`npm run build` alone is not a sufficient check.** Only `astro dev` runs Vite's dependency pre-scan, which searches `.astro` files for script and style tags without parsing the frontmatter - a literal script tag inside a _comment_ breaks the dev server while the production build stays green. Start the dev server once before calling a step done.

## 0. Goal and hard constraints

| Constraint    | Value                                                                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Target        | Astro **4.x** (not 5: the content API changed there; 4 is what the plan below assumes) |
| Runtime       | Node **20.x**, enforced by `engines` + `.npmrc engine-strict=true` as in this repo     |
| CSS           | Tailwind CSS **3.4.x** via `@astrojs/tailwind` 5.x. **Not** Tailwind 4                 |
| Visual parity | Pixel-level on every page type, light and dark. Deviations only from the list in §9    |
| URLs          | Identical to Hugo output (see §5). Trailing slashes everywhere                         |
| Language      | Code comments, docs and commit messages in English; site strings unchanged             |

The work happens in this folder (`klub_biolocation_astro/`), next to the Hugo repository, which stays intact as the reference to compare against. Before going further, commit the Hugo repository as it is (it currently has no commits at all).

## 1. Target stack (pin these)

```json
{
  "engines": { "node": ">=20.0.0 <21" },
  "dependencies": {
    "astro": "^4.16.0",
    "@astrojs/tailwind": "^5.1.0",
    "@astrojs/mdx": "^3.1.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.4.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "prettier": "^3.3.0",
    "prettier-plugin-astro": "^0.14.0",
    "prettier-plugin-tailwindcss": "^0.6.0",
    "remark-math": "^6.0.0"
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `@astrojs/mdx` is needed only for the `callout` shortcode (§6). If posts never use it, skip MDX and stay on `.md`.
- **Do not install `@tailwindcss/typography`.** The Hugo build does not have it active (verified: the compiled CSS contains no `--tw-prose-*` variables). `prose` and `not-prose` are plain hook classes styled by the theme's own `main.css`. Adding the plugin would change the typography.
- `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` must be a version whose peer dependency allows `tailwindcss ^3` (0.6.x does).
- Scripts to keep the same muscle memory: `dev` = `astro dev`, `build` = `astro build`, `check` = `astro check && prettier --check .`, `fix` = `prettier --write .`.

## 2. Phase 0 - freeze the reference (Hugo side, 15 min)

1. In the Hugo project: delete `public/` first, then `npm run build`, and keep the result as the reference output. Hugo does not remove stale pages, and a dirty `public/` produced phantom routes (`/posts/hello-world/`, `/taxonomy/`) on the first attempt.
2. Save the route list: `find public -name index.html | sed 's|public||;s|index.html$||' | sort > ../klub_biolocation_astro/reference/hugo-routes.txt`. **Done**: `reference/hugo-routes.txt` (production build, so drafts are absent).
3. Take reference screenshots (light + dark) of: `/`, `/posts/`, one post, `/tags/`, one tag page, `/categories/`, one category page, `/about/`. Headless Edge works: `msedge --headless=new --screenshot=out.png --window-size=1280,2000 <url>` against `hugo server -D`. Force dark by temporarily adding the `dark` class in `head.html` (revert afterwards), or by setting `localStorage.theme = "dark"` in a normal browser.
4. Copy the compiled CSS aside: `cp public/css/main.*.css ../klub_biolocation_astro/reference/hugo-main.css`. **Done**: `reference/hugo-main.css`. It is the source of truth for "what does utility X actually render as today" (§3.2).

## 3. Phase 1 - scaffold and CSS

### 3.1 Scaffold

```sh
npm create astro@4 -- klub_biolocation_astro --template minimal --no-install --typescript strict
cd klub_biolocation_astro
npm i astro@^4.16 @astrojs/tailwind@^5 tailwindcss@^3.4 @astrojs/mdx@^3 remark-math@^6
npm i -D prettier prettier-plugin-astro prettier-plugin-tailwindcss@^0.6
```

`astro.config.mjs`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import tailwind from "@astrojs/tailwind";
import mdx from "@astrojs/mdx";
import remarkMath from "remark-math";

export default defineConfig({
  site: "http://localhost:1313/", // set the real URL before deploying, as in hugo.toml
  trailingSlash: "always",
  build: { format: "directory" },
  integrations: [tailwind({ applyBaseStyles: false }), mdx()],
  markdown: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkMath], // keeps $...$ intact; KaTeX itself renders client-side, see §7
    shikiConfig: {
      themes: { light: "github-light", dark: "github-dark" },
      wrap: false,
    },
  },
});
```

`applyBaseStyles: false` is required: the base layer is imported by our own `main.css` so that the order (base, theme rules, custom.css) is under control.

### 3.2 Convert `main.css` from Tailwind 4 syntax to Tailwind 3

Source: `themes/void/assets/css/main.css` (about 1,000 lines). Target: `src/styles/main.css`. Mechanical replacements:

| Tailwind 4 (current file)                                             | Tailwind 3 (target)                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@import "tailwindcss";`                                              | `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`                           |
| `@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));`                     | delete; `darkMode: "class"` in `tailwind.config.cjs`                                   |
| `@source "hugo_stats.json";`                                          | delete; `content` globs in the config                                                  |

Everything else in the file is plain CSS and moves verbatim.

`tailwind.config.cjs` - the part that guarantees parity. The theme was written with Tailwind 3 class names but is currently **compiled by Tailwind 4**, whose defaults differ. The rendered site is the v4 result, so v3 has to be configured to emit the same values. All numbers below were read from the compiled Hugo CSS:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  darkMode: "class",
  content: ["./src/**/*.{astro,html,md,mdx,js,ts}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        bilingual: [
          '"Source Serif 4"',
          '"Noto Serif SC"',
          '"Source Han Serif SC"',
          '"Source Han Serif CN"',
          '"Songti SC"',
          "STSong",
          "ui-serif",
          "serif",
        ],
        code: [
          '"IBM Plex Mono"',
          "ui-monospace",
          "SFMono-Regular",
          "Menlo",
          "Monaco",
          "Consolas",
          '"Liberation Mono"',
          '"Courier New"',
          "monospace",
        ],
        ui: [
          '"IBM Plex Sans"',
          "ui-sans-serif",
          "system-ui",
          "-apple-system",
          "BlinkMacSystemFont",
          '"Segoe UI"',
          "sans-serif",
        ],
      },
      // v4 renders `shadow-sm` and `shadow` identically (v3's `shadow` value). Keep the class names, change the values.
      boxShadow: {
        sm: "0 1px 3px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 1px 2px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)",
        DEFAULT:
          "0 1px 3px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 1px 2px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)",
      },
      // v4 preflight: `border` without a colour class renders currentColor, not gray-200.
      borderColor: { DEFAULT: "currentColor" },
      // Bare `ring` and `blur` produce nothing in the current build; neutralise them instead of editing templates.
      ringWidth: { DEFAULT: "0px" },
      blur: { DEFAULT: "0" },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Values that are already identical between v3 and v4 and need nothing: `shadow-md`, `shadow-inner`, `rounded` (0.25rem), `rounded-md`, `rounded-lg`, `rounded-full`, `ring-2`, `blur-sm` (8px), `bg-gradient-to-*`, all spacing and text sizes.

Two preflight differences that cannot be configured: v3 sets `cursor: pointer` on buttons (v4 does not; the theme adds it explicitly where it matters, so no visible change) and v3 colours `::placeholder` gray-400 (the site has no inputs). Ignore both.

### 3.3 `custom.css`

Copy `assets/css/custom.css` to `src/styles/custom.css` unchanged and import it in the base layout **after** `main.css`. The `!important` rules keep working. Simplifying them (the theme is now first-party, so the palette variables could be used directly) is optional and should be a separate step after parity is confirmed.

Check for this phase: `astro build` succeeds and `dist/_astro/*.css` contains `.shadow-sm{--tw-shadow:0 1px 3px 0`, `.font-bilingual`, and the theme's `.dark body` rule.

## 4. Phase 2 - layouts and components

Hugo merges the project `layouts/` over `themes/void/layouts/`; the merged result is the source. Mapping:

Rule for every template: copy the HTML and the class attributes verbatim, replace Go template syntax with Astro expressions, and do not "improve" markup. The class names are the visual contract.

Check: `astro build` renders `/`, `/posts/`, `/about/` and diff the `<body>` markup against the Hugo `public/` files (`diff <(sed -n '/<body/,/<\/body>/p' public/index.html) <(... dist/index.html)`). Differences should be limited to asset hashes and whitespace.

### 4.1 Porting one menu item at a time

The mapping table above is organised by Hugo source file. In practice the work is easier to order by **menu item**: each entry in the header menu is a page a visitor can actually reach, so porting one is a self-contained unit with its own check. This table says which files belong to which menu item.

| Menu item      | URL            | Hugo template(s)                                                       | Astro files                                              | Status |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Home**       | `/`            | `layouts/_default/home.html` (root override)                           | `src/pages/index.astro`, `src/components/Carousel.astro` | Done   |
| **Categories** | `/categories/` | `themes/void/layouts/taxonomy/category.terms.html`                     | `src/pages/categories/index.astro`                       | Done   |
| **Posts**      | `/posts/`      | `themes/void/layouts/_default/list.html`                               | `src/pages/posts/[...page].astro`, `PostList.astro`      | Done   |
| **Tags**       | `/tags/`       | `themes/void/layouts/taxonomy/tag.terms.html` + `partials/terms.html`  | `src/pages/tags/index.astro`                             | Done   |
| **About**      | `/about/`      | `themes/void/layouts/about/single.html` (page/about.html is dead code) | `src/pages/about.astro`                                  | Done   |

Pages that are **not** reachable from the menu but share its templates, and so are best done together with the menu item that owns them:

| URL                   | Hugo template                         | Astro file                                    | Owner menu item | Status |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------ |
| `/posts/<slug>/`      | `_default/single.html`                | `src/layouts/Post.astro`                      | Posts           | Stub   |
| `/tags/<slug>/`       | `taxonomy/tag.html`                   | `src/pages/tags/[slug]/[...page].astro`       | Tags            | Done   |
| `/categories/<slug>/` | `_default/list.html` (Hugo's default) | `src/pages/categories/[slug]/[...page].astro` | Posts           | Done   |

Note on `/categories/<slug>/`: nothing links to it. The Categories page is an accordion that expands in place and links straight to `/posts/<slug>/`, so the category detail pages exist only because Hugo generates them. They share `list.html` with `/posts/`, which is why they are listed under the Posts menu item rather than Categories.

**The procedure for one menu item.** Every step is mechanical; none of them needs a judgement call.

1. Open the Hugo template named above, and only that one. `themes/void/i18n/en.toml` and the rendered `../klub_biolocation/public/<url>/index.html` are the other two files worth having open - the rendered one settles every question about what the template actually produces.
2. Copy the markup verbatim, class attributes included. Replace Go expressions with Astro ones; do not restructure. Where Hugo makes a non-anchor element clickable from a `data-` attribute, keep it that way.
3. `{{ i18n "key" }}` becomes `t.key` from `src/i18n/strings.ts`. Watch for `{{ i18n "key" | default "literal" }}`: if the key is missing from `en.toml`, Hugo renders the literal, so the literal belongs in the component and the key must **not** be invented in `strings.ts`.
4. Inline `script` and `style` blocks become `is:inline` (see the pitfalls in the project CLAUDE.md).
5. `npm run build`, then diff the markup against the Hugo page. Differences are acceptable only where Hugo's HTML minifier caused them: dropped `xmlns`, collapsed whitespace, shortened SVG path commands, self-closing versus explicit end tags, and the order of classes inside an attribute.
6. Screenshot the page against the Hugo build in both themes (see the project CLAUDE.md, "Visual check"). The target is zero differing pixels.
7. Delete the `TODO(migration §N)` comment, then update the Progress table above, this table's Status column, and the README.

## 5. Phase 3 - content and routes

### 5.1 Collection

`src/content/config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineCollection, z } from "astro:content";

const posts = defineCollection({
  type: "content",
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    date: z.coerce.date(),
    draft: z.boolean().default(false),
    description: z.string().default(""),
    tags: z
      .array(z.string())
      .default([])
      .transform((t) => t.map((s) => s.toLowerCase())), // hugo.toml: tags = [":lower"]
    categories: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
  }),
});

export const collections = { posts };
```

### 5.2 Frontmatter conversion

Hugo files use TOML frontmatter (`+++`); Astro reads YAML only. Convert the five files by hand (`content/posts/*.md`, `content/about.md`): `+++` -> `---`, `key = 'value'` -> `key: 'value'`, arrays stay as `['a', 'b']`. `content/posts/_index.md` has no Astro equivalent (the list page is `posts/index.astro`; since 2026-09-19 `posts/[...page].astro`, which also renders the further pages). The `archetypes/posts.md` template becomes a documented snippet in CONTENT.md. (Done differently on 2026-09-19: the templates are files in `templates/`, and CONTENT.md, with the Hugo guide's headings, explains how to use them; its sections on images, the About page, the home page and the menu are still to be written.)

### 5.3 Drafts

Hugo runs with `-D`, so drafts are visible in dev and hidden in production. Replicate: `getCollection("posts", (p) => import.meta.env.DEV || !p.data.draft)`. Put this in one helper (`src/lib/posts.ts`) and use it everywhere, so no page forgets the filter. (Added 2026-09-19: the owner asked for Hugo's other default as well, `buildFuture = false` - a post dated in the future is left out of the published site until its date and is still shown in dev. The same helper does it; see [PAGINATION.md](PAGINATION.md), section 2.)

### 5.4 Slugs

Hugo's `urlize` for tag and category URLs: lowercase, trim, whitespace -> `-`, keep Unicode letters and digits. Cyrillic stays Cyrillic (`/tags/энергетика-человека/`). Implement once in `src/lib/urlize.ts` and use it for every taxonomy link and `getStaticPaths` param. Post slugs are the file names, already lowercase Latin.

### 5.5 Route parity

Every route in `hugo-routes.txt` (Phase 0) must exist in `dist/`. The Hugo output also contains 9 alias pages that are not real content: `/page/1/` under `/posts/` and under every tag and category (paginator aliases; see `reference/hugo-routes.txt`). Decide once: reproduce as `redirects` in `astro.config.mjs`, or drop them (they only matter for links that were already shared). Also add `src/pages/404.astro` (Hugo has none; hosting serves its own).

Check: `find dist -name index.html | sed 's|dist||;s|index.html$||' | sort > astro-routes.txt; diff hugo-routes.txt astro-routes.txt`. Expected diff: only the `/page/1/` alias pages (§9).

## 6. Phase 4 - Markdown pipeline

| Feature              | Hugo today                                                                                                                                                            | Astro                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## 7. Phase 5 - client-side JavaScript

The theme has no build-time JS framework. Keep it that way:

| Script                                                                                           | Where it goes                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Theme bootstrap (reads `localStorage.theme`, adds `dark` to `<html>`)                            | `<script is:inline>` in `Head.astro`, **before** any stylesheet                                     |
| Theme toggle, hash highlight, TOC active state, heading anchor copy (`head/js.html`, ~300 lines) | `src/scripts/site.js`, loaded with `<script src>` via Astro (bundled, hashed). Copy verbatim        |
| Code copy buttons                                                                                | Same file; the rehype wrapper must emit `[data-code-block]` and `.copy-button` as the theme expects |
| Footnote back-link highlight                                                                     | Same file                                                                                           |
| `assets/js/main.js` (footnote cleanup inside callouts)                                           | Same file                                                                                           |
| Carousel (`home.html`, inline)                                                                   | `<script>` inside `Carousel.astro`; copy verbatim                                                   |
| Alpine.js, KaTeX + auto-render, Busuanzi                                                         | CDN `<script>` tags in `Head.astro`, same URLs and versions                                         |
| Disqus lazy loader                                                                               | Only with a configured shortname                                                                    |

Astro processes `<script>` tags by default (bundling, TS). Use `is:inline` only for the theme bootstrap and the CDN tags.

## 8. Phase 6 - verification

1. **Routes**: the diff from §5.5 is empty apart from the accepted list.
2. **Markup**: for each page type, diff the `<body>` of Hugo `public/` vs Astro `dist/` as in §4. Investigate every class-attribute difference; whitespace and asset hashes are fine.
3. **Screenshots**: repeat Phase 0 step 3 against `astro dev`, same viewport, light and dark, and compare with the reference images. `npx odiff` or `npx pixelmatch` gives a numeric diff; anything above a fraction of a percent needs a look.
4. **Console**: no errors on any page (theme toggle, copy buttons, carousel, KaTeX all initialise).
5. **Tooling**: `npm run check` exits 0; `.gitattributes`, `.npmrc`, `.vscode/settings.json` and `prettier.config.mjs` carried over from this repo (swap the Tailwind stylesheet path to `src/styles/main.css` and add `prettier-plugin-astro` to the overrides).
6. **Docs**: rewrite `README.md` and `CONTENT.md` for the new stack; keep the same headings so that the colleague finds things in the same places. Copy the "Colours and custom CSS" section almost verbatim - the mechanism is the same file.

## 9. Accepted deviations

Everything not on this list is a bug.

- Syntax-highlighting colours in code blocks: Shiki `github-light`/`github-dark` vs Chroma `github`/`github-dark`. Same palette family, not identical token colours.
- Heading ids for Cyrillic headings may differ (`github-slugger` vs Hugo). Only visible in the URL bar.
- Hugo's `/page/1/` alias pages unless reproduced as redirects.
- `index.xml` (RSS) and `sitemap.xml`: not produced unless `@astrojs/rss` and `@astrojs/sitemap` are added. Both are small; add them once parity is done.
- Fingerprinted asset paths (`/css/main.<hash>.css` -> `/_astro/*.css`). Invisible to visitors.
- Gradient interpolation. Tailwind 3 and 4 build the stop list for `bg-gradient-to-* from-<colour> to-transparent` slightly differently, so the year badge on the list and tag pages and its trailing rule differ by at most 3/255 per channel. Invisible; measured, not guessed.
- The home carousel runs under the fixed header (2026-09-09). This is the first deviation the owner asked for rather than one the stack forced, so it is worth stating plainly: `Base.astro` offsets the content by `pt-24` (6rem) while the header is shorter than that, which left a band of page background between the header and the carousel. The carousel now starts at the top of the document with `margin-top:-6rem`, and the same 6rem is added back to its height, so nothing below it moves and the visible strip grows by whatever the gap used to be. Chosen over trimming `pt-24` because that value is verbatim theme markup shared by every page, and over a measured offset because the header height varies with the viewport. Consequence: `/` is no longer pixel-identical to Hugo, and its reference screenshot has to be retaken from the Astro build rather than the Hugo one. Everything below the carousel is still expected to match.
- A responsive menu below 640px (2026-09-09), asked for by the owner. Hugo's answer at narrow widths is to let the header scroll sideways, which puts menu items behind a scrollbar. Below 640px the horizontal menu and the theme toggle are now replaced by a hamburger that opens a panel under the header, with the theme toggle inside it; at 640px and up the header is exactly what Hugo renders. The new elements are the hamburger button and the panel, both `sm:hidden`, so they are `display:none` at the widths the parity screenshots are taken at - `/about/`, `/tags/` and `/categories/` are byte-identical to Hugo at 1280px after the change. `ThemeToggle.astro` was extracted because the switch now exists twice in the document; it lost its `id`, which nothing referenced from CSS.
- The menu keeps its compact sizes until 768px instead of 640px (2026-09-09). Hugo grows the row at `sm:` - `sm:space-x-4`, `sm:text-lg`, `sm:px-3 sm:py-2` - but between 640px and 767px the grown row plus the title plus the theme toggle stopped fitting, and because the header is `fixed` the excess could not be scrolled to: at 700px the row reached 680px against 661px of usable width and the theme toggle was cut off. Those three bumps moved to `md:`, which closes the band without touching the hamburger threshold - the owner chose to keep that at 640px. Verified: nothing extends past the right edge at 645, 700, 760 or 1280px, and `/about/` is byte-identical to Hugo at both 800px and 1280px, so the change really is inert from 768px up.
- The carousel's pause button changes its icon (2026-09-09), asked for by the owner. The theme's own script assigns `iconPause.hidden = paused`, and `hidden` is an `HTMLElement` property while these icons are `SVGElement`, so the assignment did nothing and the button kept one icon forever - measured in a headless browser, and true of the Hugo site as well. The two assignments became `setAttribute`/`removeAttribute`; the markup, which declares the initial state with the same attribute, is untouched. This is a deliberate divergence from a faithful port: the port reproduced the bug correctly.
- The wordmark collapses to its initials below 400px (2026-09-09), asked for by the owner. Under that width the logo plus "Radiesthesia Club" no longer fit and `truncate` produced "Radiesthes...", which reads worse than a monogram. `Header.astro` derives the initials from `site.title` rather than hard-coding "RC", and swaps the two spans with the arbitrary variant `min-[400px]:`, so no Tailwind screen had to be added for a single rule. The anchor gained `aria-label={site.title}`: the accessible name is then the full title at every width, whichever span is painted. 400px is a judgement call, not a measurement - verified by eye at 320, 360, 400 and 480.
- The About page avatar doubles as a header logo below 640px (2026-09-09), asked for by the owner. `site.avatar` renders as a 32px round image inside the existing home link, `sm:hidden`, so it is `display:none` at 640px and up. The wordmark's `max-w-[40%]` had to become `max-w-[70%]` at the same breakpoint, otherwise the title truncated to "Radiesthes..."; `sm:max-w-md` above it is untouched. The image is `alt=""` on purpose - the link's own text already announces the site name.
- `main.overflow-x-auto` instead of `main` in the carousel stylesheet (2026-09-09). This one is a bug fix, not a deviation the owner asked for: `Base.astro` gives `main` the utility classes `overflow-x-auto sm:overflow-visible`, and a class selector beats an element selector, so Hugo's own `main{overflow:visible}` never applied below 640px. `overflow-x:auto` forces `overflow-y` to compute to `auto`, which made `main` a scroll container - it clipped the carousel's negative top margin, so the gap under the header reappeared on narrow screens, and the full-bleed carousel gave `main` a horizontal scrollbar along the bottom of the viewport. Hugo has both symptoms. Measured after the fix at 475-676px on `/`, `/about/`, `/posts/` and `/tags/hugo/`: no horizontal scrollbar and no inner scroll container anywhere. The home page still reports 7px of `scrollWidth` overflow, because `width:100vw` on the carousel counts the vertical scrollbar; `html{overflow-x:clip}` swallows it and no scrollbar appears.
- Pagination is not built. Hugo paginates lists at 10 items and the site has two posts, so Hugo currently emits no pagination markup at all and there is nothing to match. This has to be revisited before an eleventh post is published; Hugo's URLs are `/posts/page/2/`. **Superseded on 2026-09-19:** the owner asked for pagination, and it is built - 5 posts a page (the owner's choice, not Hugo's 10), Hugo's URLs, and the theme's own Previous and Next markup. The Posts list is paginated by year, as the owner asked: /posts/<year>/ holds only that year, and Previous and Next stay inside it; a year switcher above the list chooses the year. Tag and category pages were paginated across years for a few hours and are split by year too since the evening of 2026-09-19, at the owner's request, through the same code (`paginateByYear()`, `ListByYear.astro`): `/tags/<slug>/<year>/`, `/tags/<slug>/<year>/page/<n>/`, and the same for categories. One deliberate difference from the theme: each page shows only its own posts, whereas both theme templates loop over every post and would repeat the whole list on every page. Twenty-one posts were added so that the pages exist, and a stress test with up to 100 pages a year passed. See [PAGINATION.md](PAGINATION.md).
- The pagination buttons are the same on every list (2026-09-19), the owner's decision after the reviewer noticed two shapes. The theme's `list.html` gives Previous and Next `rounded-md` with dark-mode colours; its `tag.html` gives them `rounded-full` and no `dark:` classes, so the tag pages had round buttons that stayed white in dark mode. The Hugo site never rendered either block, so the difference was never visible there. `tags/[slug]/[...page].astro` now puts `list.html`'s classes on its buttons and page numbers, keeps tag.html's SVG arrows, and lists the theme's original classes in a comment. Later the same day the block became one component, `src/components/Pagination.astro`, for every list, and the owner chose tag.html's SVG chevrons for its arrows - so the Posts list and the category pages now show chevrons where `list.html` has the text arrows `&larr;` and `&rarr;`. The theme's original classes moved to a comment in the component.
- The light palette is no longer the theme's (commit `125643b`, 2026-09-19, made on GitHub while the pagination work was in progress and brought in with a rebase, unchanged). `custom.css` sets the page background to `#f5f5f4` (Tailwind `stone-100`, was the theme's `gray-50`, `#f9fafb`) and the panels - header bar, post cards, About card - to `#fafaf9` (`stone-50`, was white). Dark mode is untouched. The same commit added three candidate colours to `tailwind.config.cjs`, `bio-mint`, `bio-lavender` and `bio-warm`, faint tints of light grey; no class uses them yet. They had been written as a second `colors` key of `theme.extend`, which JavaScript resolves to the last one, so the pinned palette silently replaced them; they were moved into the pinned block, with the original lines kept as a comment. Nothing to check against the Hugo stylesheet: these colours are new.
- The hand-built links to tags and categories end with a slash (2026-09-19 evening): the tag chips on the cards, "All Tags" at the foot of a tag page and the category label above an article now point at `/tags/hugo/`, `/tags/` and `/categories/blog/`, where Hugo prints them without the slash. The owner reported the result: under `trailingSlash: "always"` Astro's dev and preview servers answer the slash-less address with 404 (GitHub Pages redirects it). The addresses of the pages are unchanged. See `REVIEW-FIXES.md` section 5.

## 10. Suggested session split

Each block fits one short session with limited context; finish the check before moving on.

1. §2 + §3 (scaffold, CSS, config) - the build must be green with an empty page that already loads both stylesheets.
2. §4 for `Base`, `Head`, `Header`, `Footer`, `index.astro` with the carousel - compare the home page.
3. §5 + `posts/index.astro` + `Post.astro` - compare the list and one post.
4. Taxonomy pages + About - compare all four.
5. §6 rehype plugins (code blocks, footnotes) + TOC - compare a post with code, footnotes and math.
6. §7 scripts + §8 full verification + §9 review + docs.

Do not start a session by re-reading the whole Hugo theme: the tables above name the exact source file for each target, and the reference `public/` output shows what the result must look like.
